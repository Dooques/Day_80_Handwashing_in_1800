Hi there! This is my first official upload to GitHub. I have been slowly working through the 100 Days of Code 
course on Udemy over the last 8 months while working full time. I just learned that 'building in public' is the
best way to get a headstart in software development through the Self-Taught Devs podcast by Eric Winkelspecht and
Matt Erlich. Props to them for creating a wonderful resource for other self taught devs like me.

I will be updating this repository over the next few days / week as I work through the lesson. 

If you happen across this, please comment and give advice as you may already be able to tell, I definitely need it.

Thanks for visiting!
